Bases Loaded Baseball Version History

Current Version: V0.7.0

V0.8.0 - begins to implement the usage of SQL databases to store stats and other info
    this will take a while to re-learn, then transition to this storage method

V0.7.0 - implement a 'menu' that allows the user to play more than one game
    still only using the Blue Jays and Swansons for now
    will track stats over ALL games, not just the most recent one

V0.6.3 - begin to implement some derived statistics, more to come later
    includes AVG, OBP, SLG, OPS, XBH, TB for batters
    includes BAA, OBP, WHIP, ERA, K/9, K/BB for pitchers

V0.6.2 - implements methods to increment ER and IP

V0.6.1 - implements the methods created in V0.6.0 to accumulate player stats over time
    will not increment ERs and IP yet

V0.6.0 - begins to implement "object-oriented" stat tracking methods for players
    will track raw batting stats like H, 2B, 3B, HR, BB, R, RBI, AB, PA?
    will track raw pitching stats like H, BB, GO, AO, K, TBF, ER, IP
    will not implement two-way players (like Shohei Ohtani) yet
        will implement after the game is in working order

V0.5.0 - begins to fix some "situational baseball" circumstances like GIDPs and SFs
    on a fly out with a runner on 3rd, 25% chance of a SF
    on a groundout with a runner on first:
 	    - 60% chance of GIDP 
	    - 25% chance of FC, out at 2nd
	    - 15% chance of groundout, runner advances to 2nd
    on a ground ball with bases loaded:
	    - will try to do a 2-3 DP (these percentages needs to be able to vary)
		    - 5% chance of GIDP
		    - 10% chance of FC, out at home
		    - 85% chance of trying a standard DP instead (see probabilities above)
